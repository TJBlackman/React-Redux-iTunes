## React + Redux iTunes

Demo: https://react-redux-itunes.netlify.com

A small demo project I built while learning about Redux and state managment in general. Allows the user to search for songs, movies, tv shows, and podcasts that exist within the iTunes Store. Includes previews for songs, tv shows, and movies.
